# I Have Subwayed

## Description

*I Have Subwayed* (name pending lol) is a cool game/tracker to display how much of the NYC Subway you've traveled. It starts as a blank map and allows you to color in segments as you've ridden that part of the system.

## How we use this repo

(Subject to change obvs)

- GitHub issues to track work and feature ideas
- A CHANGELOG.md file to track our changes
- A CONTRIBUTING.md file to document how we work
    - How we make decisions
    - How we use our repo
    - Where we do our planning

## Decisions to be made

### App/product decisions
